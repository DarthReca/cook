    ""To make the Ragu: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery (the soffritto), and pancetta. Cook slowly for 15-20 minutes until softened, sweet, and fragrant, but not browned."",

    ""Pour in the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot to deglaze any browned bits. Allow the wine to bubble and evaporate completely."",
    ""Stir in the milk and let it simmer gently until it has been almost completely absorbed by the meat. This step is crucial for a tender and creamy ragu."",

    ""Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting, cover the pot partially, and let the ragu simmer for a minimum of 3 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the richer the flavour. The final sauce should be thick and luscious. Remove the bay leaf and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg."",
    ""To make the Béchamel: While the ragu simmers, gently heat the milk in a saucepan until just below boiling, then set aside. In a separate, medium saucepan, melt the 60g of butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the 60g of flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to form a smooth paste (a roux)."",
    ""Gradually pour the hot milk into the roux, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for about 8-10 minutes until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon."",
    ""Remove the béchamel from the heat and season with salt, white pepper, and a generous grating of fresh nutmeg."",
    ""To assemble the lasagna: Preheat your oven to 180°C. Lightly grease a 20x30 cm rectangular baking dish."",
    ""Spread a thin layer of ragu on the bottom of the dish to prevent the pasta from sticking. Arrange a single layer of fresh lasagna sheets over the sauce."",
